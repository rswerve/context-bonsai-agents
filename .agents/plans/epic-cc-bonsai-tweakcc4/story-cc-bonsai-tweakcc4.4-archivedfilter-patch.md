# Story: archived-filter patch — the context-shrink patch

**Epic:** Re-implement Context Bonsai for Claude Code on tweakcc 4.0
**Size:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Story 2 (`patches/types.ts`, registry, harness), Story 3 (`patches/discovery.ts`)

## Story Description

Implement `patches/archived-filter.patch.ts` — the patch that makes context actually shrink, and the direct fix for the bug that motivated this epic.

The patch targets Claude Code's transcript visibility predicate: the function `function X(Y){switch(Y.type){...}}` that decides which messages are included when the request is assembled. The patch injects, ahead of that switch, code that on first use reads `~/.claude/archived-<session>.json` (the marker file the MCP server writes), caches it with mtime tracking, and returns "not visible" (false) for any message whose `uuid` is in the archived list. Archived messages therefore never reach the provider — context shrinks.

This story expresses the filter as a `BonsaiPatch` transform module per epic Contract A, using Story 3's `discovery.ts` for both patch-point location and runtime-helper resolution (`fsFunc` to read the marker file). There is no external reference source in this worktree; implementers must derive behavior from the epic contracts, committed fixtures, current code, and live Claude Code/tweakcc APIs available through the story validation flow.

Per epic Contract A the module exports one `BonsaiPatch` with `name: "archived-filter"` and `sentinel: "/*cb:archived-filter:v1*/"`. Per epic Contract C that sentinel is the single artifact the MCP server (Story 7) scans the running binary for to confirm the patch is live — this story injects it; Story 7 reads it; there is no separate state file.

The `apply` transform runs in the harness process (trusted, not the `adhoc-patch` sandbox). The *injected* code runs later inside Claude Code with full host access — it uses a `globalThis` cache and Bun host APIs; that distinction matters for the native-binary acceptance check below.

## User Model

### User Gamut

Examples only:

- A developer deep in a long Claude Code session who prunes a range and needs the token count to actually drop.
- A developer on a native install — the case where the old port silently did nothing.
- A developer on an npm `cli.js` install.
- The maintainer verifying, after a Claude Code release, that the visibility-predicate anchor still resolves.

### User-Needs Gamut

Examples only:

- Prune that measurably reduces tokens sent to the provider — not just a success message.
- Correct behavior on the native binary, not only on `cli.js`.
- The injected filter must not break unrelated transcript rendering or non-archived messages.
- A cache that picks up marker-file changes (a later retrieve) without restarting Claude Code.

### Design Implications

- Patch-point location goes through `discovery.selectUnique` — no bespoke regex; the visibility predicate is one of 133 `switch(X.type)` sites.
- The injected reader must fail safe: a missing/empty/corrupt marker file means "filter nothing," never a crash.
- The injected code uses host globals (`globalThis` cache, `Buffer`); this story verifies the snippet deterministically in unit/runtime tests and preserves a target-artifact hook, but real repacked-native execution is deferred unless an approved repo-local pinned native artifact is present.
- Full functional proof (prune → measured token drop, secret oracle) and release-gate pinned native runtime evidence are owned by Story 8's Protocol A and pinned-target artifact evidence. This story's own bar is that the patch applies, self-verifies, and the injected runtime snippet behaves correctly against fixtures/unit tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `patches/archived-filter.patch.ts` exports a `BonsaiPatch` with `name: "archived-filter"` and `sentinel: "/*cb:archived-filter:v1*/"`.
- [ ] The patch locates the visibility predicate via `discovery.selectUnique` and resolves `fsFunc` via `discovery.findRuntimeHelpers` — no bespoke matchers.
- [ ] `apply` throws `BonsaiPatchError` (fail closed) if the anchor is not uniquely resolved.
- [ ] After `apply`, `verifySentinel` confirms the sentinel is present exactly once.
- [ ] The injected runtime code reads `~/.claude/archived-<session>.json`, caches with mtime tracking, and filters archived UUIDs; a missing/empty/corrupt marker file filters nothing and does not throw.
- [ ] The module is registered in `patches/registry.ts` as the first patch.
- [ ] **Native-binary evidence boundary:** if an approved repo-local pinned native artifact/copy exists under the epic target-artifact contract, run the archived-filter harness/repack runtime smoke and record that the injected host-global usage (`globalThis` cache, `Buffer`/fs access) executes without `ReferenceError`; otherwise explicitly defer real native-binary runtime evidence to Story 8's release gate. Story 4 must still provide deterministic apply, sentinel, unit, and runtime-snippet coverage.
- [ ] `bun run typecheck` and `bun test` pass.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Read the marker-file helpers in `compact.ts` and derive the patch behavior from the epic contracts, committed fixtures, current code, and live Claude Code/tweakcc APIs available through validation.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- Implement the `BonsaiPatch`: locate the visibility predicate via `discovery`, build the injected reader/cache/filter snippet, splice it in, append the sentinel.

### Phase 3: Integration

- Register the module in `patches/registry.ts` (position 1).

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- Unit tests against fixtures; if an approved repo-local pinned native artifact is present, run the native repack + runtime smoke check. Otherwise record the deferral of real native-binary runtime evidence to Story 8 while keeping deterministic Story 4 coverage.

## Step-by-Step Tasks

1. Read the `compact.ts` marker helpers and derive the filter behavior from the epic contracts, committed fixtures, current code, and validation artifacts available in this worktree.
2. Implement `archived-filter.patch.ts` as a `BonsaiPatch` using `discovery`.
3. Define the injected snippet: marker read, mtime cache, archived-UUID filter, fail-safe on missing/corrupt file.
4. Append the `/*cb:archived-filter:v1*/` sentinel; self-verify with `verifySentinel`.
5. Register the module in `patches/registry.ts` as patch 1.
6. Write `archived-filter.patch.test.ts` (fixture-based unit tests).
7. If an approved repo-local pinned native artifact/copy is present, run the harness against it and smoke-test the repacked binary's injected host-global usage; otherwise defer that real native-binary runtime evidence to Story 8's release gate.
8. Run `bun run typecheck` and `bun test`.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit: anchor resolution on fixtures, fail-closed on a no-match fixture, sentinel self-verification, the injected filter's behavior incl. missing/corrupt marker file.
- Anchor-evidence bar: tests and review evidence must prove this patch targets the actual provider-bound transcript visibility path in the pinned Claude Code target. Synthetic fixtures may test helper mechanics, but happy-path fixtures and sentinel-only checks are not acceptance evidence. Include evidence that plausible non-visibility `switch(X.type)` sites are wrong, ambiguous plausible anchors fail closed, no-match fails closed, and the chosen anchor changes the required model-facing behavior; do not weaken `minScore`/`minMargin` or fail-closed behavior to pass. Missing semantic anchor analysis is a HIGH/CRITICAL review finding depending on release impact.
- Native integration: apply via the Story 2 harness to an approved repo-local pinned native artifact/copy, repack, run, and confirm the injected code executes without a host-global `ReferenceError`. If no approved repo-local pinned native artifact/copy is present, record a Story 8 release-gate deferral rather than using ambient machine state.
- Full functional proof (token reduction, secret oracle) is exercised in Story 8.
