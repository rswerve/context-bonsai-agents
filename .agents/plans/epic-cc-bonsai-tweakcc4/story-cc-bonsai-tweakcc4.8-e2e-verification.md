# Story: End-to-end verification for native Claude Code

**Epic:** Re-implement Context Bonsai for Claude Code on tweakcc 4.0
**Size:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Stories 4, 5, 6, 7 (verifies the fully integrated system)

## Story Description

Adapt the e2e protocol to the native-install + tweakcc-4.0 apply flow and run it to a full PASS. A full PASS is the epic's release gate.

Two mandatory test classes, plus the existing scenario set:

**(a) Install-procedure e2e test.** Per the project rule that a documented install path is not done until verified end-to-end from a clean state: start from a clean machine (a fly.io sprite — see `docs/installation-e2e-template.md`), run the documented apply commands *verbatim* (Story 2's harness; MCP registration in `~/.claude.json` per Story 7), and verify the bonsai tools end up not just registered but **functional** — a prune actually reduces context. A documented path that has only been reasoned about does not pass.

**(b) Protocol A — secret-prune oracle.** In a fresh session: seed a unique secret, have the assistant acknowledge it without over-repeating, prune the secret-introducing message (the secret must not appear in tool arguments, summary, or index terms), forbid further tool use, then ask for the secret. The model must be unable to reveal it from active context. The oracle is **invalidated** if the secret appears anywhere unpruned in the transcript — the protocol must check that explicitly.

**(c) Pinned-target artifact evidence.** Because this epic forward-ports a patch-based integration to a minified closed-source host, the release gate must produce or refresh the evidence record for the epic's pinned target: Claude Code native `2.1.143` Linux x64 extracted with tweakcc `4.0.13` or compatible `4.0.x`. The evidence must include the extraction tool/version, exact reproduction command or harness entry point, extracted bundle checksum, candidate count(s), selected anchor evidence, timestamp, and operator. Patch-anchor evidence must explain why each chosen location is the semantically correct Claude Code behavior seam and why plausible nearby candidates are wrong. Syntax matches, candidate counts, sentinel insertion, or synthetic fixtures are not acceptable release-gate evidence by themselves. It must exclude credentials, session transcripts, and `~/.claude` auth/config data.

Adapt the existing protocol document `tweakcc_context_bonsai/docs/e2e-protocol.md`: it already covers scenarios E2E-01..07; add the install-procedure scenario, and align it to native + tweakcc 4.0. While editing, **correct the stale `settings.json` references to `~/.claude.json`** — they occur at `e2e-protocol.md` lines 9, 46, and 64 (all three; Story 7 confirms the authoritative file). `docs/context-bonsai-e2e-template.md` is the cross-port template to align with.

The patch stories (4, 6) deliberately delegate full functional/Protocol-A proof to this story; this story owns it as the integrated release gate.

## User Model

### User Gamut

Examples only:

- The maintainer deciding whether the epic is shippable.
- An operator who will trust the install doc only because it was verified clean-room.
- A reviewer auditing whether "bonsai works for Claude Code" is an evidenced claim.
- A future contributor re-running the protocol after a Claude Code release to detect regressions.

### User-Needs Gamut

Examples only:

- Proof that prune actually reduces tokens — not that a tool returned success text.
- Proof that the documented install commands work verbatim from a clean state.
- A reproducible protocol any contributor can re-run.
- A secret-oracle result that is sound — explicitly invalidated if the secret leaked into unpruned transcript.
- Patch-anchor artifact evidence grounded in the real pinned Claude Code behavior, not made-up fixtures or syntax-only matches.

### Design Implications

- Clean-state verification uses a fly.io sprite so the dev machine's pre-installed dependencies cannot color the result.
- The install test runs the *documented* commands, not bespoke ones — it tests Story 9's doc as much as the code.
- Native is the primary verified path; npm `cli.js` is smoke-checked, not deeply exercised.
- Provider credentials for the sprite are out-of-band and never committed (see the installation-e2e template's Phase 0).
- Target artifact evidence is about the Claude Code binary/bundle only; it never includes provider credentials, session transcripts, or `~/.claude` auth/config data.
- Target artifact evidence is valid only if it documents semantic anchor analysis for the pinned target and records fail-closed behavior for plausible wrong, ambiguous, and no-match cases; sentinel checks are necessary but not sufficient.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `tweakcc_context_bonsai/docs/e2e-protocol.md` is updated for the native + tweakcc-4.0 flow and adds an install-procedure scenario.
- [ ] All three `settings.json` references in `e2e-protocol.md` (lines 9, 46, 64) are corrected to `~/.claude.json`.
- [ ] The install-procedure test runs the documented apply commands verbatim from a clean fly.io sprite and verifies the tools are functional (a prune measurably reduces context), not merely registered.
- [ ] The Protocol A secret-prune oracle is specified and executed, including the explicit invalidation check that the secret never appears in unpruned transcript, tool arguments, summary, or index terms.
- [ ] The existing scenario set (E2E-01..07) is run against the integrated system; results are recorded with PASS/BLOCKED/FAIL verdicts and evidence.
- [ ] A pinned-target artifact evidence record is produced or refreshed for Claude Code native `2.1.143` Linux x64, including extraction tool/version, exact reproduction command or harness entry point, extracted bundle checksum, candidate count(s), selected anchor evidence, timestamp, and operator. The evidence must explain the semantic role of each selected anchor, why plausible nearby candidates are wrong, and must exclude credentials, session transcripts, and `~/.claude` auth/config data.
- [ ] Release-gate patch-anchor evidence includes required negative coverage: plausible wrong candidates rejected, ambiguous candidates fail closed, no-match fails closed, and the chosen target is proven by pinned-target behavior without weakening fail-closed `minScore`/`minMargin` thresholds.
- [ ] A full PASS run is recorded as the epic's release gate.
- [ ] `bun run typecheck` and `bun test` still pass (no regression in the side repo).

## Context References

### Relevant Codebase Files (must read)

- `tweakcc_context_bonsai/docs/e2e-protocol.md` - existing protocol (E2E-01..07); stale `settings.json` at lines 9, 46, 64.
- `docs/context-bonsai-e2e-template.md` - cross-port e2e template incl. Protocol A; align the protocol to it.
- `docs/installation-e2e-template.md` - the fly.io sprite clean-state procedure; Phase 0 credentials are out-of-band.
- `tweakcc_context_bonsai/apply/apply-bonsai.ts` - the documented apply path under test (Story 2).
- `tweakcc_context_bonsai/mcp-server/index.ts` - the patch-presence guard (Story 7) the protocol exercises.

### New Files to Create

- A runnable e2e harness/script under `tweakcc_context_bonsai/` (or an extension of the existing protocol's scripts) for the install-procedure and Protocol A scenarios.

### Relevant Documentation

- The epic, all three Shared Implementation Contracts, and the Target Release And Artifact Contract.
- `docs/context-bonsai-agent-spec.md` "Minimum Validation Scenarios" — the scenario set this story must cover.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Read the existing protocol, the cross-port template, and the installation-e2e template.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- Update `e2e-protocol.md` for native + tweakcc 4.0; add the install-procedure scenario; fix the three `settings.json` lines.
- Specify the Protocol A oracle with the explicit invalidation check.
- Specify the pinned-target artifact evidence step and credential boundary.
- Specify that patch-anchor artifact/e2e evidence is based on semantic analysis of the real pinned target, and that sentinel checks do not replace semantic anchor validation.

### Phase 3: Integration

- Build the runnable harness for the install-procedure and Protocol A scenarios on a fly.io sprite.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- Execute the full protocol; record verdicts and evidence; confirm a full PASS gate.
- Produce or refresh the pinned-target evidence record before declaring the epic release gate passed.
- Confirm the pinned-target evidence records plausible-wrong/ambiguous/no-match fail-closed cases and explains why the chosen anchors are the correct behavior seams.

## Step-by-Step Tasks

1. Read `e2e-protocol.md`, `docs/context-bonsai-e2e-template.md`, `docs/installation-e2e-template.md`.
2. Update `e2e-protocol.md` for the native + tweakcc-4.0 flow; correct `settings.json` → `~/.claude.json` at lines 9, 46, 64.
3. Add the install-procedure scenario (clean sprite → documented commands verbatim → functional prune check).
4. Specify the Protocol A secret-prune oracle with the invalidation gate.
5. Add the pinned-target artifact evidence step and credential boundary to the protocol/run record.
6. Add reviewer-enforceable evidence checks that reject syntax-only matches, missing negative evidence against plausible wrong anchors, synthetic-fixture-only claims, and sentinel-only proof for patch anchors.
7. Build the runnable e2e harness/script.
8. Execute the full protocol on a fly.io sprite; record PASS/BLOCKED/FAIL with evidence.
9. Produce or refresh the pinned-target evidence record, then confirm and record the full-PASS release gate; run `bun run typecheck` and `bun test`.

## Testing Strategy

- This story *is* the test story: e2e on a clean fly.io sprite. Native install is primary; npm `cli.js` gets a smoke check.
- Evidence favors model-visible transcript over internal logs, per the spec's Evidence Expectations.
- Pinned-target artifact evidence favors binary/bundle metadata, semantic anchor notes, and runtime behavior; it must not include credentials or session content.
- Synthetic fixtures and sentinel-only checks are insufficient for patch-anchor release evidence; plausible wrong, ambiguous, no-match, and behavior-proven chosen-target cases must be recorded.
- Each scenario gets an explicit PASS/BLOCKED/FAIL verdict; a missing dependency is BLOCKED, not FAIL.

## Validation Commands

- `cd tweakcc_context_bonsai && bun test`
- `! grep -n 'settings\.json' tweakcc_context_bonsai/docs/e2e-protocol.md`
