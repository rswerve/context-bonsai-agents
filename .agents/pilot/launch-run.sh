# Launch one pilot run of the bonsai-orchestrator, teeing ALL output —
# including the PILOT-PROCESS-EXITED marker — into the run log the
# observer watches. Run 2's marker printed only to the tmux pane, so the
# observer's log watcher could never fire; the braces below route the
# marker through the same tee as the run output.
#
# PILOT_DRYRUN=1 substitutes a no-op for the orchestrator so the
# marker-reaches-log plumbing can be verified before a real launch.
#
# Expected mid-run behavior (run-3 precedent, watchdog-ratified for
# run 4): a provider 429 quota error stalls the run silently — the
# provider SDK sleeps out the retry-after in-process and the session
# self-resumes at quota reset. On any silent stall, the observer checks
# the newest ~/.local/share/opencode/log/*.log for session.processor
# errors and verifies self-resume at the retry-after horizon BEFORE
# considering any injection; injection requires watchdog sanction.
