# Task Brief: Routine Forward-Port Cycle — OpenCode onto v1.17.13

You are the process orchestrator for one routine forward-port cycle. Your working directory is this repository root (`context-bonsai-agents/`); every relative path below starts there.

## Reading order (before any other action)

1. `.llm-conductor/ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT.md` — your operating pattern. You coordinate; subagents implement. You never edit implementation files yourself.
2. `docs/agent-specs/forward-port-spec.md` — the cycle specification. Read the front matter ("Relationship to the other documents", "How a routine cycle uses this spec"), Part 1, Part 2 (git-fork shape), and §4.2 (the OpenCode slot). Part 3 and §4.3 are the closed-artifact shape and do not apply to this cycle.

The spec is authoritative for every cycle step. This brief supplies only what the spec says the invoker supplies, plus orchestration wiring. If this brief and the spec ever disagree, the spec wins — and record the disagreement in the friction log (below).

## Cycle inputs (frozen; supplied by the invoker)

- `SOURCE_REF`: `refs/heads/replay/context-bonsai-on-opencode-1.15.7` (the port branch in the `opencode/` fork repository; the release tag `bonsai/v1-on-opencode-1.15.7` points at the same commit)
- `SOURCE_HEAD_SHA`: `0dfbeeda7d8a273c52a564333c8179c68d6ab04d`
- `UPSTREAM_REF`: `refs/tags/v1.17.13`
- Harness slot: OpenCode (§4.2); shape: git-fork (Part 2)
- The opt-in validation mode of §1.11 is not requested for this cycle.

## Orchestration wiring (ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT.md placeholder values)

- `[ORCHESTRATOR_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH]`: `.llm-conductor/ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT.md`
- `[DEVELOPER_SUBAGENTS_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH]`: `.llm-conductor/DEVELOPER_SUBAGENTS.md`
- `[REVIEWER_SUBAGENTS_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH]`: `.llm-conductor/REVIEWER_SUBAGENTS.md`
- `[REVIEW_JUDGE_SUBAGENTS_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH]`: `.llm-conductor/REVIEW_JUDGE_SUBAGENTS.md`
- Project specification files (judge required reading): `docs/agent-specs/forward-port-spec.md`, `docs/agent-specs/context-bonsai-e2e-spec.md`
- `[STORY_CONTEXT_PATH]`: this brief, plus the cycle plan under `.agents/plans/` once §1.14 produces it.
- All other placeholders in `ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT.md` have no corresponding file in this project. Do not ask for them. Where a subagent instruction document calls for a project specification path, use the two specification files above.

Launch subagents with the task tool, using the agents defined in `opencode.json`: `bonsai-developer`, `bonsai-reviewer`, `bonsai-judge`. The two independent reviewers the spec's §1.15 validation loop requires are two separate fresh `bonsai-reviewer` launches per iteration. Your reviewer+judge gates satisfy the spec's §1.8 two-approver contract; no human approval is required on the routine path.

## Non-negotiable orchestration rules

- Execute the spec's five-step sequence ("How a routine cycle uses this spec") in order. The §1.15 validation loop and step 5 (§1.16 routine maintenance) are mandatory, not optional.
- If a spec STOP or hard-fail fires: stop that path. Append a STOP report to the friction log — which STOP, its spec section, the exact evidence, and which assumption of the OpenCode slot (§4.2) or the git-fork shape (Part 2) it calls into question. Never weaken a threshold, ambiguity rule, or gate to keep moving. Do not attempt the spec's §1.17 escalation derivation yourself; it belongs to a different tier. Write the final report (below) and end the run.
- Friction log: `.agents/pilot/gpt55-v1.17.13-friction-log.md`. Append an entry whenever any of these happens: a subagent fails or is relaunched, a spec instruction is ambiguous or missing for the situation at hand, a command fails unexpectedly, a gate fails, or you or a subagent act beyond the spec's text. Record facts only — UTC timestamp, cycle phase and spec section, what happened, what was done next. Do not classify or excuse entries; classification happens outside this run.
- Do not modify `docs/agent-specs/forward-port-spec.md` while the cycle is running (seal gate 12). §1.16 maintenance edits happen only after the seal, and touch Part 4 only.
- Do not touch: pre-existing directories under `opencode/.agent_tmp/` from prior cycles; the `tweakcc_context_bonsai` submodule pin (its dirty state is pre-existing and out of scope); this brief; `opencode.json`.
- Commit messages must have a body, never a subject line alone.

## Final report

When the cycle seals — or halts at a STOP — write `.agents/pilot/gpt55-v1.17.13-final-report.md` containing: the outcome (sealed, or stopped at which spec section), commits made in each repository, which seal gates passed, the §1.16 maintenance outcome and where its report lives, and a pointer to the friction log. Keep it under a page.
